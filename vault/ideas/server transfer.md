A server transfer does not refer to players moving between server towns, but instead enabling 2 hosted game servers to send and receive character data. A use case for this might be for a player to transfer a character they started on a friend's hosted server to one of their own to continue playing and advancing that character.

One method of this would be to give the player data on the server to the player so it can be backed up or dropped into character data on the new server.

Another method, a more immersive and seamless method, would be for both players to have their hosted servers set up and then use a built in method to transfer the character. Something like this:

1. server A and server B are set up
2. a player on server A wants to transfer to server B
3. server A admins whitelist transfers to server B
4. player logs on to server A and asks the server for a transfer code
5. player logs in to server B
6. player submits transfer code
7. character and other data are downloaded to server B
8. player confirms transfer and transfer code is submitted to delete character data from server A, optionally deleting account if there is no plan to return
	1. should transfers expire?
	2. if transfers expire, character and account data are untouched, transfer code is deleted
