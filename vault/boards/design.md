## idea

- [ ] design server town layout
- [ ] determine NPC shops
- [ ] 2d vs 3d
- [ ] what does combat look like
- [ ] determine client and server roles
- [ ] should the server own and sync all npc/monster interactions?
- [ ] [[map system | maps and npcs]]
- [ ] players can teleport between set points and other players
- [ ] admin NPCs help players with transfers
- [ ] desired items for vendors and quests for all NPCs
- [ ] world/story quests?
